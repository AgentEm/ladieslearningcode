        </section>
        
        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Different types of web design:</h2>
            <p>In order to understand mobile/responsive web design and development, we have to understand what our options are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed</li>
                <li>Fluid</li>
                <li>Adaptive</li>
                <li>Responsive</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Fixed web design</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li class="delayed">What it sounds like!</li>
                    <li class="delayed">Everything has a set width (eg. 960px). A holdover from before mobile "smart" devices were common.</li>
                    <li class="delayed">Resize the browser, or look at it on a mobile screen and nothing will change</li>
                    <li class="delayed">You'll need an "m dot" site if you want something mobile friendly :( </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="delayed">Example: <a href="http://toronto.ca">toronto.ca</a> </br>(open this up on your phone or use the web inspector)</p>

            <h2>Fluid web design</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li class="delayed">Based on percentages</li>
                    <li class="delayed">Each block of content takes up some percentage of the page, for example a sidebar with a width of ~30% and main section with a width of ~70%</li>
                    <li class="delayed">When you resize the browser, the blocks of content will resize relative to the size of the page (aka the "viewport")</li>
                    <li class="delayed"><strong>Not</strong> made for specific devices. Just reducing the width of your content is usually not the best experience for small screens, doesn't give us enough control.</li>

            <h2>Adaptive web design</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li class="delayed">Uses a series fixed layouts</li>
                    <li class="delayed">Then adds in media queries to target specific viewport sizes</li>
                    <li class="delayed">The content itself changes</li>
                    <li class="delayed">Best to think of it as a <em>set</em> of fixed layouts that are envoked in response to the device size</li>

                <ul>
                    <li class="delayed">Uses a fluid grid layout to get that sweet free adaptability</li>
                    <li class="delayed"><em>Also</em> uses media queries to change the look and feel depending on device size</li>
                    <li class="delayed">So your grid is both <strong>flexible</strong> inbetween common device sizes, and designed with <strong>breakpoints</strong> so that content is presented in the most suitable way for the device.</li>
                    <li class="delayed">Content stays largely the same or similar.</li>

          <blockquote>"When you lose 80% of your screen real estate, all the extraneous bloat that tends to finds its way onto large screen designs doesnâ€™t seem so attractive or necessary anymore. Mobile provides a great opportunity to reevaluate what content/functionality is necessary and gives us an opportunity to strip away the cruft across the board (and not just for mobile users either). These constraints also encourage ease-of-use, intuitiveness and speed as essential ingredients to a good user experience."

          <h1>Crash Course in HTML5</h1>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
        <h2>A bit of background info</h2>
          <p>HTML5, or "HyperText Markup Language" is what we wrap the <strong>content</strong> of our site in. It's the only thing you truly need to have a website.</p>
          <p>However, it takes on default styles of the browser. Uuuuugly. We'll learn how to override these styles in a bit with CSS, which is where we do all our cosmetic changes.</p>
          <p>For now, let's open up our starter HTML file, <strong>html-ex1.html</strong> in your <strong>"examples" folder</strong></p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
          <h2>This is it!</h2>
          <p>This is everthing you need for your HTML file to work properly in a browser.</p>
          <p>NOTE: those things inside of <code>&lt;!-- --&gt;</code> are comments!</p> 
          <p>Go ahead and type anything inside the <code>&#60;body&#62;&#60;&#47;body&#62;</code> tags</p>
          <p>Then refresh your browser's page to see the results!</p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Tags/Elements

Those things with the angled brackets are called HTML "elements", they tell the browser what kind of content each of the bits of your website is.

There's almost always an "opening" tag and a "closing" one. The closing tag has a forward slash. Example: opening paragraph tag: `&#60;p&#62;` closing paragraph tag: `&#60;&#47;p&#62;`

You close tags in the reverse order in which they appear, just like in math. For example, in this code block:

```xml
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;paragraph wrapped in a link wrapped in a span&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
```
The span opens, the `a` (a link or "anchor" tag) opens, then the paragraph opens. The paragraph closes, the link closes, then the span closes.
        </section>
        
        <section class="slide">
        <h2>Important Note!</h2>
          <p>Remember, HTML is about content, it has default browser styles but it is not for styling your document. That's what CSS is for, and we need to keep the both separate!</p>
          <p>So let's review what we've learned so far and keep going. Open up our second HTML example file, <strong>html-ex2.html</strong></p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Siblings, Parents, and Children</h2>
            <p>Elements can have "relationships" with other elements in the HTML document.</p>
            <p>If you put one element inside of another, the element on the outside is the <strong>"parent"</strong> element, while the one inside is the <strong>"child"</strong> element. You can have many child elements inside of a parent, but they all only have one parent.</p>
            <p>Two or more elements that are both children of the <em>same</em> element are called <strong>"siblings"</strong> - they are on the same level as each other. For example the <code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</code>elements in every HTML document</p>
        </section>
        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Parent, Child, Siblings Example</h2>
            <pre><code>
&lt;body&gt; &lt;!--this body element is a parent to the div element and normally a child of the html element--&gt;
  &lt;div&gt; &lt;!--this div is a child of the body element, and a parent of the p elements--&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am a sibling of the p below me! I am also a child of the div.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am a sibling of the p above me! I am also a child of the div&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
            </code></pre>
            <p>Notice the way that the tags are indented, so that you can easily read the HTML and see what is a child, parent, and sibling of what elements. This will come in handy later, so keep up this way of indenting (2 spaces or one tab)</p>
        </section>
        <section class="slide">
          <h2>HTML Element Relationships:</h2>
          <p>Don't worry about what each of these are, we'll go over that very soon. Just look at the structure.</p>
          <img src="framework/img/DOM_tree.png" />
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
          <h2>What are all the Elements?</h2>
          <p>We'd be here all day if we had to go over every single HTML5 element - there's so many!</p>

          <p>Don't worry, you don't by any means need to memorize all of these!</p>
          <p>For your reference, I've made a list of the most commonly used tags in the <strong>examples folder</strong> called <strong>html-elements.txt</strong>. Take a look!</p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
          <h2>One more thing...HTML Attributes!</h2>
          <p>Elements can have things called "attributes". There's also lots of attributes, but don't worry there's only a few you'll need to know for this workshop:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>"class" or "id", used mostly for styling</li>
            <li>"href", used in the opening anchor tag, it contains a URL for the link</li>
            <li>"alt", used as alternate text if the website can't represent the content or a screen reader is being used</li>
            <li>"src", meaning source, used mostly for images, gives the url path for the embedded content</li>
            <li></li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Intro to CSS</h2>
          <p>CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets"</p>
          <p>CSS is what we use to tell the browser how to style our HTML document - it's for making things pretty <strong>and usable/accessible</strong></p>
          <p>Just like HTML, CSS has it's own way of writing it that we have to learn. It looks a little something like this:</p>
<textarea class="snippet" data-subject="#intro-css">background-color: lightblue;
font-family: "Times New Roman", serif;</textarea>
            <div id="intro-css" class="example">

            </div>
        </section>
        
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##CSS and HTML

A CSS document is made up of a bunch of lines of code, or "rules", that keep referring back to the HTML elements in our HTML document

These rules are always made up of a **selector** and one or more **declarations**. Each declaration has a **property** and a **value**.

```css
selector {
  property: value;
}
```

The **selector** tells what element(s) to apply the styling to. The **declaration** contains what styles to apply. 
```css
h1 {
  color: red;
}
``` 
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
          <h2>An Example</h2>
          <pre><code>
            body {
              background-color: pink;
              color: white;
              font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
              font-size: 16px;
            }

            p {
              border: 1px solid #333;
              color: #000;
              font-weight: italic;
            }
          </code></pre>
          <p>Here we have two selectors (body and p) and they each have their own sets of declatarions inside the { } brackets. The body selector has four declarations, while the p selector has three.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
          <h2>An Example cont.</h2>
          <pre><code>
            div {
              border: 3px solid #333;
              background-color: lightblue;
            }
          </code></pre>
          <p>Notice that each declaration ends in a semi-colon, and starts on a new line. In addition each property ends in a colon. These are necessary for the browser to understand your styles. The colon and semi-colon are used here a lot like they are in English!</p> 
          <p>Although you could write all the styles on one line, that's hard to read, so always format your CSS rules this way</p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
          <h2>Writing CSS - Where Does it Go?</h2>
          <p>You can technically put CSS in one of three places: inline, internal, and in it's own document (linked/external).</p>
          <p>In this class, we're going to skip the first two because they're not good practice anyway, and go straight to making our own CSS documents.</p>
          <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> We've already seen inline styles used in our examples with the "style" attribute, and internal CSS is just CSS rules all together inside the head element, using a style tag.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
          <h2>Let's make HTML and CSS documents and link them!</h2>
          <p>In your examples folder you have <strong>html-ex4.html</strong> and <strong>css-ex4.css</strong> and they're both blank.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>First, lets write some content in our HTML document</li>
            <li>Next, we'll write some CSS styles to make it look different</li>
            <li>Finally we'll get them working together by linking them in the HTML</li>
          </ol>
        </section>

          <h2>Critical CSS Concepts</h2>
          <p>There are a few things we need to learn about in order to understand our final project.</p>
          <p>Open up the whole folder called <strong>final-project</strong> in your text editor. These files will work together to make our entire web page.</p>

##CSS Selectors
###Type Selectors
```css
div {
  /*styles for all divs on the page*/
}

a {
  /*styles for all links on the page*/  
}

p {
  /*styles for all paragraphs on the page*/
}
```
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##CSS Selectors cont.
###Descendant Selectors
```css
div p {
  /*all paragraphs that are descendants of any divs*/
}

ul li a {
  /*links inside of list items inside of unordered lists. 
  Question: will this affect links inside of ordered lists (ol's)?*/
}
```
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##CSS Selectors cont.
###Class Selectors
```css
.container {
  /*styles for all elements with a class of container, no matter what type*/
}

p.container {
  /*styles for all paragraph elements with a class of "container"*/
}

p.container a {
  /*guess what this one does!*/
}
.container .warning {
  /*how about this one?*/
}

.container.warning {
  /*styles for all elements with BOTH a class of container and warning*/
}
```
        </section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##CSS Selectors cont.
###Grouping
```css
h1, h2, h3 {
  /*all h1, h2, and h3's*/
}

p, li, a {
  /*what will this one select?*/
}

.warning, a, p.cats {
  /*what will this one select?*/
}
```
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
          <h2>CSS Selectors cont.</h2>
          <p>Let's look at our final project CSS and HTML files again, and try to find each type of selector we've just learned about:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Type Selectors</li>
            <li>Descendant Selectors</li>
            <li>Class Selectors</li>
            <li>Grouping</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
          <h2>Inheritance</h2>
          <p>If we look at <strong>styles.css</strong> in the final-project/stylesheets directory, we see a bunch of styles with a "GLOBAL STYLES" title on top of them</p>
          <p>Look at the body selector. It has a font set on it. But our webpage clearly has paragraphs and other elements we could declare a font on. Why is it on body then?</p>
          <p>Remember that CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets? Now we know what they mean by cascading! The browser reads the CSS from the top of the page down.</p>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
##Specificity
###What's going on here? Why are there so many "h2"'s?
```css
h2, h3, h4 {
  font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif;
  font-weight: 400;
  margin: 0;
}

h2, h3 {
  text-transform: uppercase;
}

h2 {
  font-size: 32px;
}

section h2 {
  border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}
```

        </section>

        <section class="slide">
          <p>The most specific OR the most recent CSS rule will be selected. Which one gets selected is based largely on magic.</p>
          <p>GENERAL RULE: the styles for an element that came last in the CSS document will be used, unless overridden by a more "specific" selector. Classes, for example, make things more specific than just a type selector would be.</p>
          <p>Example:</p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
          <h2>Starting our Final Project!</h2>
          <p>We now know enough to get started on our project for today! But don't worry, we'll be learning more CSS and practicing HTML as we go along.</p>
          <p>Now open <strong>index.html</strong> in your browser - where are all the styles? Why does it still look like the default styling?</p>
        </section>


        <section class="slide">
          <h2>Colours!</h2>  
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
          <h2>Fonts!</h2>  
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
          <h2>Borderbox and Clearfix</h2>
          <p>We're going to use these two things to help us make more sense of CSS styling.</p>
          <p>Clearfix will allow us to "clear" floats. If you float a child, it's parent can't "see" it anymore, and the height of that parent will collapse.</p>
          <p>When this happens, we simply add a class of clearfix (.clearfix) on to the parent div and boom! Everything's fixed.</p>
        </section>


        <!--<section class="slide">
            <h2>More CSS demos</h2>
            <p>You can also target specific elements rather than the whole slide.</p>
            <textarea class="snippet" data-subject="#test">color: slateblue;
font-family: "Times New Roman", serif;
padding: 20px;</textarea>
            <div id="test" class="example">

            </div>

            <p>Just like the previous example, the CSS is added in a <code>textarea</code> element but also include a <code>data-subject</code> attribute.</p>  

            <p>In the element to be targeted, add an <code>id</code> with a value that matches the <code>data-subject</code> of the  <code>textarea</code> and add a class of <code>.example</code> to add the border style. (View the source for this slide.)</p>

            <h2>Presentation mode</h2>

            <p>This slide has presenter notes. They are only visible in presenter view (Ctrl+P or Shift+P).  Just add the <code>.presenter-notes</code> class to the element container the notes.

            <p>Check out the notes in this slide!</p>

            ##CSS Customizations

            The CSS for this template is written in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/).  For your forked copy of these slides, feel free to use either Sass or the compiled CSS files. Just note that if you pull in any styles updates from the repo, the CSS files will be recompiled.

            If you want to change the intro slide background image (or not use an image at all), change the style using the `.intro` class.

            The text in the slide can automatically scale based on window size. If you want to turn this feature "on" or off", in **framework > sass > _variables.scss** under font sizes, use the `rem` values for scalable text and `px` values for non-scalable text. (You can still zoom in with the pixel sized text.)
            
            Avoid changing the base styles files (`_mixins.scss`, `_variables.scss` and `theme-llc.scss`). Put all of your customizations and workshop specific styles in workshop.scss.  If you'd like to add an improvement or enhancement, please submit a pull request or email [christina@ladieslearningcode.com](mailto:christina@ladieslearningcode.com).
        </section> -->
<!-- 
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
            ##Other Customizations

            The progress bar at the top of the page can be defined by adding the presentation duration, in minutes, in the `data-duration` attribute on the `body` tag.  If you do not want to use it at all, leave the value empty.

            The text in the slide can automatically scale based on window size. If you want to turn this feature "on" or off", in **framework > sass > _variables.scss** under font sizes, use the `rem` values for scalable text and `px` values for non-scalable text. (You can still zoom in with the pixel sized text.)

            Since most, if not all, links included in the workshops are to external resources, all links open in a new window to avoid participants clicking away from the slide presentations.  Note that this feature is included using `&lt;base target="_blank"&gt;` added just after the opening `body` tag. 

            (See more about the [`base`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base) tag.)
