            <h1>What is Responsive Design?</h1>
        </section>
        
        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Different types of web design:</h2>
            <p>In order to understand mobile/responsive web design and development, we have to understand what our options are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed</li>
                <li>Fluid</li>
                <li>Adaptive</li>
                <li>Responsive</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Fixed web design</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li class="delayed">What it sounds like!</li>
                    <li class="delayed">Everything has a set width (eg. 960px). A holdover from before mobile "smart" devices were common.</li>
                    <li class="delayed">Resize the browser, or look at it on a mobile screen and nothing will change</li>
                    <li class="delayed">You'll need an "m dot" site if you want something mobile friendly :( </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="delayed">Example: <a href="http://toronto.ca">toronto.ca</a> </br>(open this up on your phone or use the web inspector)</p>
                <p class="delayed">Example: <a href="https://m.facebook.com/">m.facebook.com</a></p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Fluid web design</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li class="delayed">Based on percentages</li>
                    <li class="delayed">Each block of content takes up some percentage of the page, for example a sidebar with a width of ~30% and main section with a width of ~70%</li>
                    <li class="delayed">When you resize the browser, the blocks of content will resize relative to the size of the page (aka the "viewport")</li>
                    <li class="delayed"><strong>Not</strong> made for specific devices. Just reducing the width of your content is usually not the best experience for small screens, doesn't give us enough control.</li>
                </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Adaptive web design</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li class="delayed">Uses a series fixed layouts</li>
                    <li class="delayed">Then adds in media queries to target specific viewport sizes</li>
                    <li class="delayed">The content itself changes</li>
                    <li class="delayed">Best to think of it as a <em>set</em> of fixed layouts that are envoked in response to the device size</li>
                </ul>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>And finally...responsive web design!</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li class="delayed">Uses a fluid grid layout to get that sweet free adaptability</li>
                    <li class="delayed"><em>Also</em> uses media queries to change the look and feel depending on device size</li>
                    <li class="delayed">So your grid is both <strong>flexible</strong> inbetween common device sizes, and designed with <strong>breakpoints</strong> so that content is presented in the most suitable way for the device.</li>
                    <li class="delayed">Content stays largely the same or similar.</li>
                    <p class="delayed">Example: <a href="http://goo.gl/JNfJ5X">goo.gl/JNfJ5X</a></p>
                    <p class="delayed">What do you notice about the changing layout?</p>

            <h2>One more concept: mobile-first design</h2>
            <p>We used to design with only a desktop in mind, this has changed with smartphones and tablets, giving rise to "mobile first design"</p>
            <p>What is it?</p>
            <li class="delayed">Design an experience for mobile devices first, then desktop, making mobile integral, not an afterthought</li>
            <li class="delayed">"Graceful Degradation" and "Progressive Enhancement" - fancy words for simple things</li>
            <li class="delayed">A bit difficult to think this way, but worth it to give all users the best experience possible</li>

          <blockquote>"When you lose 80% of your screen real estate, all the extraneous bloat that tends to finds its way onto large screen designs doesnâ€™t seem so attractive or necessary anymore. Mobile provides a great opportunity to reevaluate what content/functionality is necessary and gives us an opportunity to strip away the cruft across the board (and not just for mobile users either). These constraints also encourage ease-of-use, intuitiveness and speed as essential ingredients to a good user experience."

          <h1>Crash Course in HTML5</h1>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
        <h2>A bit of background info</h2>
          <p>HTML5, or "HyperText Markup Language" is what we wrap the <strong>content</strong> of our site in. It's the only thing you truly need to have a website.</p>
          <p>However, it takes on default styles of the browser. Uuuuugly. We'll learn how to override these styles in a bit with CSS, which is where we do all our cosmetic changes.</p>
          <p>For now, let's open up our starter HTML file, <strong>html-ex1.html</strong> in your <strong>"examples" folder</strong></p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
          <h2>This is it!</h2>
          <p>This is everthing you need for your HTML file to work properly in a browser.</p>
          <p>NOTE: those things inside of <code>&lt;!-- --&gt;</code> are comments!</p> 
          <p>Go ahead and type anything inside the <code>&#60;body&#62;&#60;&#47;body&#62;</code> tags</p>
          <p>Then refresh your browser's page to see the results!</p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
          <h2>Tags/Elements</h2>
          <p>Those things with the angled brackets are called HTML "elements", they tell the browser what kind of content each of the bits of your website is.</p>
          <p>There's almost always an "opening" tag and a "closing" one. The closing tag has a forward slash. Example: opening paragraph tag: &#60;p&#62; closing paragraph tag: &#60;&#47;p&#62;</p>
          <p>You close tags in the reverse order in which they appear, just like in math. For example, in this code block:</p>
          <pre><code>
        &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;paragraph wrapped in a link wrapped in a span&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          </code></pre>
          <p>The span opens, the "a" (a link or "anchor" tag) opens, then the paragraph opens. The paragraph closes, the link closes, then the span closes.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section class="slide">
        <h2>Important Note!</h2>
          <p>Remember, HTML is about content, it has default browser styles but it is not for styling your document. That's what CSS is for, and we need to keep the both separate!</p>
          <p>So let's review what we've learned so far and keep going. Open up our second HTML example file, <strong>html-ex2.html</strong></p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Siblings, Parents, and Children</h2>
            <p>Elements can have "relationships" with other elements in the HTML document.</p>
            <p>If you put one element inside of another, the element on the outside is the <strong>"parent"</strong> element, while the one inside is the <strong>"child"</strong> element. You can have many child elements inside of a parent, but they all only have one parent.</p>
            <p>Two or more elements that are both children of the <em>same</em> element are called <strong>"siblings"</strong> - they are on the same level as each other. For example the <code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</code>elements in every HTML document</p>
        </section>
        <section class="slide">
            <h2>Parent, Child, Siblings Example</h2>
            <pre><code>
&lt;body&gt; &lt;!--this body element is a parent to the div element and normally a child of the html element--&gt;
  &lt;div&gt; &lt;!--this div is a child of the body element, and a parent of the p elements--&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am a sibling of the p below me! I am also a child of the div.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am a sibling of the p above me! I am also a child of the div&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
            </code></pre>
            <p>Notice the way that the tags are indented, so that you can easily read the HTML and see what is a child, parent, and sibling of what elements. This will come in handy later, so keep up this way of indenting (2 spaces or one tab)</p>
        </section>
        <section class="slide">
          <h2>HTML Element Relationships:</h2>
          <p>Don't worry about what each of these are, we'll go over that very soon. Just look at the structure.</p>
          <img src="framework/img/DOM_tree.png" />
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
          <h2>What are all the Elements?</h2>
          <p>We'd be here all day if we had to go over every single HTML5 element - there's so many!</p>
          <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/HTML5_element_list" alt="HTML5 element list">Here's a handy list of all the ones in use today</a>. The ones with the little orange "5" beside them are new for HTML5.</p>
          <p>Don't worry, you don't by any means need to memorize all of these!</p>
          <p>For your reference, I've made a list of the most commonly used tags in the <strong>examples folder</strong> called <strong>html-elements.txt</strong>. Take a look!</p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
          <h2>One more thing...HTML Attributes!</h2>
          <p>Elements can have things called "attributes". There's also lots of attributes, but don't worry there's only a few you'll need to know for this workshop:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>"class" or "id", used mostly for styling</li>
            <li>"href", used in the opening anchor tag, it contains a URL for the link</li>
            <li>"alt", used as alternate text if the website can't represent the content or a screen reader is being used</li>
            <li>"src", meaning source, used mostly for images, gives the url path for the embedded content</li>
            <li></li>
          </ul>
          <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes" alt="List of HTML attributes">Here's another handy list</a> of all of them!</p>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
          <h2>Enough talk, more code!</h2>
          <p>Now that we've gone over a lot, let's go through an HTML document together and practice what we've learned!</p>
          <p>Open up <strong>html-ex3.html</strong> from your examples folder.</p>

          <h1>Goodbye Defaults, Hello CSS!</h1>
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
          <h2>Intro to CSS</h2>
          <p>CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets"</p>
          <p>CSS is what we use to tell the browser how to style our HTML document - it's for making things pretty <strong>and usable/accessible</strong></p>
          <p>Just like HTML, CSS has it's own way of writing it that we have to learn. It looks a little something like this:</p>
          <textarea class="snippet">background-color: lightblue;
          font-family: "Times New Roman", serif;</textarea>
        </section>
        
        <section class="slide">
          <h2>CSS and HTML</h2>
          <p>A CSS document is made up of a bunch of lines of code, or "rules", that keep referring back to the HTML elements in our HTML document</p>
          <p>These rules are always made up of a <strong>selector</strong> and one or more <strong>declarations</strong></p>
          <p>Each declaration has a <strong>property</strong> and a <strong>value</strong></p>
          <p>The selector tells what element(s) to apply the styling to</p>
          <p>The declaration contains what styles to apply</p>  
        </section>

        <section class="slide">
          <h2>An Example</h2>
          <pre><code>
            body {
              background-color: pink;
              color: white;
              font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
              font-size: 16px;
            }

            p {
              border: 1px solid #333;
              color: #000;
              font-weight: italic;
            }
          </code></pre>
          <p>Here we have two selectors (body and p) and they each have their own sets of declatarions inside the { } brackets. The body selector has four declarations, while the p selector has three.</p>
        </section>

            <p>You can also target specific elements rather than the whole slide.</p>

            </div>

            <p>Just like the previous example, the CSS is added in a <code>textarea</code> element but also include a <code>data-subject</code> attribute.</p>  

            <p>In the element to be targeted, add an <code>id</code> with a value that matches the <code>data-subject</code> of the  <code>textarea</code> and add a class of <code>.example</code> to add the border style. (View the source for this slide.)</p>

            ##CSS Customizations

            The CSS for this template is written in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/).  For your forked copy of these slides, feel free to use either Sass or the compiled CSS files. Just note that if you pull in any styles updates from the repo, the CSS files will be recompiled.

            If you want to change the intro slide background image (or not use an image at all), change the style using the `.intro` class.

            The text in the slide can automatically scale based on window size. If you want to turn this feature "on" or off", in **framework > sass > _variables.scss** under font sizes, use the `rem` values for scalable text and `px` values for non-scalable text. (You can still zoom in with the pixel sized text.)
            
            Avoid changing the base styles files (`_mixins.scss`, `_variables.scss` and `theme-llc.scss`). Put all of your customizations and workshop specific styles in workshop.scss.  If you'd like to add an improvement or enhancement, please submit a pull request or email [christina@ladieslearningcode.com](mailto:christina@ladieslearningcode.com).

            ##Other Customizations

            The progress bar at the top of the page can be defined by adding the presentation duration, in minutes, in the `data-duration` attribute on the `body` tag.  If you do not want to use it at all, leave the value empty.

            The text in the slide can automatically scale based on window size. If you want to turn this feature "on" or off", in **framework > sass > _variables.scss** under font sizes, use the `rem` values for scalable text and `px` values for non-scalable text. (You can still zoom in with the pixel sized text.)

            Since most, if not all, links included in the workshops are to external resources, all links open in a new window to avoid participants clicking away from the slide presentations.  Note that this feature is included using `&lt;base target="_blank"&gt;` added just after the opening `body` tag. 

            (See more about the [`base`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base) tag.)
